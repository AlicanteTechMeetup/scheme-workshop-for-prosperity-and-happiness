# scheme-workshop-for-prosperity-and-happiness

code from the workshop + small bonus + some comments, work in progress (or maybe not).


edit February 2016:

Attention attention, Ladies and Gentlemen! Check out the new wonderful document on scheme programming written by the grand schemer Panicz Godek (and co-edited by the Guile users community), available here: http://panicz.github.io/pamphlet/

it covers some trendy applications including linear algebra, genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic, and fundamentals of machine learning (oh yeah!).

don't be fooled by the title, it's not against R in particular, it's against all the crappy wunderkinder of the evolution of programming concepts (c++, java, php, c#, ... -- you name them!).
